####WindowFlex gives you control over your Xcode windows.

Tired of conforming to the standard Xcode window constraints?, sigh no more. It's time to question the status quo.
WindowFlex unlocks the default window constrains, giving you the options of having your window be 600 in width
while having the toolbar visible. You are also free to configure your toolbar on a project per project basis.

It's awesome.

A big shout out goes out to Beno√Æt Bourdon [@benoitsan](https://github.com/benoitsan).
He made [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode) which includes private Xcode headers and some convenience methods that is being used in this project.
Without his tremendous work this might not have ever happened.
