A big shout out goes out to Beno√Æt Bourdon [@benoitsan](https://github.com/benoitsan).
He made [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode) which includes private Xcode headers and some convenience methods that is being used in this project.
Without his tremendous work this might not have ever happened.
