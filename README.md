####Marvin is a plugin for Xcode, it adds a large collection of text selections, duplication and deletion commands.

It includes the following commands (some might seem obvious but some need a little more detail to describe its function and value).

- Delete Line
- Duplicate Line
- Join Line
- Move To EOL and Insert LF
- Proper Save
  - This command will remove trailing whitespace and add a CR at the end of the document before saving
- Select Current Word
- Select Line Contents
  - This differs a bit from Select Line as it will exclude whitespace characters until it reaches the first valid character at both the beginning and end of the current line
- Select Next Word
- Select Previous Word
- Select Word Above
- Select Word Below

A big shout out goes out to Beno√Æt Bourdon [@benoitsan](https://github.com/benoitsan).
He made [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode) which includes private Xcode headers and some convenience methods that is being used in this project.
Without his tremendous work this might not have ever happened.
